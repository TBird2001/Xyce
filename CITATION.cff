abstract: >-
  Xyce is an open-source, SPICE-compatible, high-performance analog circuit
  simulator developed at Sandia National Laboratories. It supports serial
  execution on a variety of systems, including Linux, MacOS and Windows. Xyce
  can also be built to run in parallel on large-scale computing platforms, with
  support for several parallel solvers, making it capable of solving extremely
  large circuit problems. In addition to the standard SPICE analyses, Xyce
  supports Harmonic Balance, Random Sampling Analysis, and sophisticated
  sensitivity analysis methods. It can also couple to other tools via a C API,
  which can be leveraged via Python, MatLab, or other codes. Finally, Xyce has
  a robust set of standard compact models, and it supports a subset of
  Verilog-A through an ADMS-based back-end that can be used for compact model
  development.
